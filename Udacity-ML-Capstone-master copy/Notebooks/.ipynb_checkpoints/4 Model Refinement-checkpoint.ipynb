    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filter` parameter specifies the number of nodes in each layer. Each layer will increase in size from 16, 32, 64 to 128, while the `kernel_size` parameter specifies the size of the kernel window which in this case is 2 resulting in a 2x2 filter matrix. \n",

The pooling layer is do reduce the dimensionality of the model (by reducing the parameters and subsquent computation requirements) which serves to shorten the training time and reduce overfitting. The Max Pooling type takes the maximum size for each window and the Global Average Pooling type takes the average which is suitable for feeding into our `dense` output layer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our output layer will have 10 nodes (num_labels) which matches the number of possible classifications. The activation is for our output layer is `softmax`. Softmax makes the output sum up to 1 so the output can be interpreted as probabilities. The model will then make its prediction based on which option has the highest probability."
